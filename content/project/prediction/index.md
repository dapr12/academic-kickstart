Parents of children with complex diseases require easily understandable information about their disease to improve health outcomes. Improved disease understanding will allow better shared decision making between clinicians and families. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare and complex disease of hypoglycaemia associated with significant neurodevelopmental morbidity. Children with inadequately controlled or inappropriately treated hypoglycaemia can have lifelong neurodisability with a significant consequential impact on the family, society and the NHS.
